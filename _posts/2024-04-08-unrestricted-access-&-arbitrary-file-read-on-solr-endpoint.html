| Hello there. It has been two years since the last blog post, but I've been very busy getting     |
| some certs, breaking apart routers and other devices and, most importantly, getting a job :D.    |
| This time, I will be writing about my last two bounties, given by a very big company related to  |
| videogames that, unfortunately, I cannot disclose.                                               |
|                                                                                                  |
| It all started when I received an email from a HackerOne private program saying that a new       |
| domain was up and running. Given that the program itself is a very old and hardened one, I       |
| decided to give it a try since it could be a very good opportunity to hack it. I fired up Burp   |
| and started looking around.                                                                      |
|                                                                                                  |
|                                                                                                  |
| [ Recon ]                                                                                        |
|                                                                                                  |
| After some recon and many hours figuring out how to register a new account (it only allowed US   |
| citizens but didn't specify it), I found an API endpoint that disclosed many URLs from the admin |
| interface. I immediately visited some of them and noticed that they were all accessible for      |
| regular users, however, the functionalities in them didn't work because the API endpoints they   |
| were using were actually restricted. Although this obviously didn't give me the ability to do    |
| anything as an admin, I visited all of the URLs looking for something interesting to look into.  |
| Eventually, I found a dashboard that had a completely different look than the rest of the        |
| application:                                                                                     |

| Some googling later, I found that this dashboard is a fork of Kibana named <a href="https://github.com/LucidWorks/banana">Banana</a> and is used    |
| to work with Apache Solr, which is a search platform written in Java that usually contains a lot |
| of important data and, therefore, is a very juicy target. So, I looked at the endpoints that the |
| dashboard was using and found the Solr endpoint itself:                                          |
|                                                                                                  |
|     /api/solr/banana                                                                             |
|                                                                                                  |
| It didn't respond with any data, but it also didn't throw any errors and the response            |
| corresponded to that given directly by Solr, so this meant that any user could interact directly |
| with the endpoint. Great, that was worth a look.                                                 |
|                                                                                                  |
| After learning about Solr and reading some articles about common vulnerabilities and             |
| misconfigurations such as <a href="https://github.com/veracode-research/solr-injection/">this one</a>, I started by trying to get all cores available, which, very  |
| roughly, are kind of the different sets of data available in the Solr endpoint. This is done by  |
| requesting the following resource:                                                               |
|                                                                                                  |
|     /api/solr/admin/cores                                                                        |
|                                                                                                  |
| Which successfully responded with more than 100 results such as "User", "UserLoginHistory",      |
| "EntityPayment", etc. They could be queried at:                                                  |
|                                                                                                  |
|     /api/solr/&lt;core>/select?q=&lt;query>                                                            |
|                                                                                                  |
| For example, to query all entries in the "User" core, we would request:                          |
|                                                                                                  |
|     /api/solr/User/select?q=*                                                                    |
|                                                                                                  |
| However, it was not that easy.                                                                   |

|                                                                                                  |
| [ Getting unrestricted access ]                                                                  |
|                                                                                                  |
| Although the Solr endpoint could be used by regular users, the information available was         |
| restricted to that accessible by each user. As an example, querying *all user data* with         |
| "/api/solr/User/select?q=*", would only give us *our* user data. This restriction was            |
| implemented by also executing a default query containing default conditions such as "only        |
| retrieve data belonging to this user". This behavior could be seen in the raw response from the  |
| Solr endpoint, in which the attribute "params" contained a list of the executed queries, named   |
| "q", with two elements: the default query set by the server ("( tenantId:1 AND ...") and the     |
| query requested by the user, ("*"):                                                              |

| This mechanism was not mentioned in any post about hacking Solr and it might even have been      |
| custom to this application, so it required some additional tinkering.                            |
|                                                                                                  |
| One of the *classic* ways to trick Solr into doing some nasty things is by using the "qt"        |
| parameter. If enabled, it allows rewriting the request handler, which is what tells the server   |
| how to process the request. For example, in the case of "/api/solr/User/select", the request     |
| handler would be "/select". Other request handlers are "/config", "/update", etc. Essentially,   |
| this means that the following request:                                                           |
|                                                                                                  |
|     /api/solr/User/select?qt=/config                                                             |
|                                                                                                  |
| Would be rewritten as:                                                                           |
|                                                                                                  |
|     /api/solr/User/config                                                                        |
|                                                                                                  |
| In fact, sometimes, the rewrite affects everything that the parameter "qt" includes. For         |
| example, the following request:                                                                  |
|                                                                                                  |
|     /api/solr/User/select?qt=/test-handler?param=1337                                            |
|                                                                                                  |
| Would be rewritten to:                                                                           |
|                                                                                                  |
|     /api/solr/User/test-handler?param=1337                                                       |
|                                                                                                  |
| // Obviously, I am not a Solr developer so I don't know the inner workings of this feature.      |
| // Be aware that this behavior may only affect certain versions and configurations and the       |
| // explanations here may not be as correct as the ones provided by Solr docs.                    |
|                                                                                                  |
| This way, I played extensively with the "qt" parameter until I found that the following request: |
|                                                                                                  |
|     /api/solr/User/select?qt=/select?hacked&q=*                                                  |
|                                                                                                  |
| Would produce the following response:                                                            |
|                                                                                                  |

|                                                                                                  |
|                                                                                                  |
|                                                                                                  |
| As you can see, the raw response from the Solr endpoint shows only one parameter "q", instead    |
| of two as before, the parameter "qt" and a new parameter "hacked?q" with the contents of the     |
| previous restrictive default "q". What is happening here is something like the following:        |
|                                                                                                  |
| 1. The server receives the request "/api/solr/User/select?qt=/select?hacked&q=*" and processes   |
|    the parameters in alphabetical order.                                                         |
| 2. The server processes parameter "q" and adds the query "*" to be executed.                     |
| 3. The server processes parameter "qt" and rewrites the URL from "/api/solr/User/select" to      |
|    "/api/solr/User/select?hacked".                                                               |
| 4. When it has finished processing the parameters supplied by the user, the server appends the   |
|    default query to restrict access to other user's data to the URL without the user supplied    |
|    parameters: "/api/solr/User/select?hacked?q=&lt;default_query>"                                  |
| 5. The server processes the remaining parameters, in this case, "hacked?q", which does nothing.  |
|                                                                                                  |
| This way, the default query that restricted access to other user's data gets bypassed, allowing  |
| the retrieval of all the information available in the Solr endpoint. In the case of the "User"   |
| core, which contained all kinds of personal information, there were 796,165 entries, as can be   |
| seen in the previous image. Also, there were other cores mentioned before with critical data     |

| Then, after I reported the Unrestricted Access, I continued looking into the Solr endpoint. I    |
| tried many payloads I found around for RCEs and path traversal vulnerabilities and discovered    |
| that only "GET" requests were allowed, which limited many of the payloads that could possibly    |
| work. Although there are some ways to get around this with some shadowy parameters, such as      |
| the aforementioned "qt", none of them worked.                                                    |
|                                                                                                  |
| I ended up looking at the <a href="https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Aprojectdiscovery%2Fnuclei-templates%20solr&type=code">nuclei templates repository</a>, since it has been a very useful source of |
| exploits and payloads for certain technologies in the past, and actually found some techniques   |
| to exploit Solr instances that I hadn't seen anywhere else.                                      |
|                                                                                                  |
| <a href="https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei-templates/blob/main/http/vulnerabilities/apache/apache-solr-file-read.yaml">One of the techniques</a> allowed Arbitrary File Read on Solr versions <= 8.8.1 and used the         |
| following payload the contents of "/etc/passwd":                                                 |
|                                                                                                  |

| At first, it didn't work since it seemed like the server was only accepting requests to          |
| "/api/solr/User/select". However, after some tinkering, I was able to use once more the          |
| parameter "qt" to rewrite the URL from "/api/solr/User/select" to "/api/solr/User/debug/dump"    |
| and sucessfully exfiltrate the contents of "/etc/passwd"! The resulting payload was:             |
