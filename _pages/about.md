Hello there, I am hacefresko, a young hacker who loves everything about tech. I am currently working as a web pentester, while doing some vuln research in IoT devices and some occasionally bug bounty hunting in my free time. In this blog I will be posting about cool vulnerabilities that I've found and I could bring something valuable to the hacking community. Anyways, enjoy and feel free to contact me on any of the provided links :)
