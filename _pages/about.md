Hello there, I am hacefresko, a young guy from Spain who loves hacking and tech in general, and likes to do some vuln research and occasional bug bounty hunting. In this blog, I'll be posting about cool vulnerabilities I've found that I think could bring something valuable to the hacking community. Anyways, enjoy and feel free to contact me on any of the provided [links](/links) :)
